<h1>REMOTE SQUASH COACHING</h1>
	<h2>Video-based coaching.</h2>
	<h4>"Not everybody is lucky enough to have access to an on-court coach."</h4>
	<hr>
		  <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
		  <p>This service makes it easy to have your game analysed, both technically AND tactically.&nbsp;&nbsp;All from the comfort of your home!&nbsp;&nbsp;You record yourself playing, send it to me and I analyse it and send a video back, showing how to improve.&nbsp;&nbsp;When you are ready to start or if you have any questions, email me: <a href="mailto:squashcoachphillip@gmail.com?Subject=RemoteSquashCoach">squashcoachphillip@gmail.com</a>.</p>

			<h2>HOW IT WORKS</h2>
			<hr class="grey">
			<r-grid columns="2">
			<r-cell span-s=row >
					<h1 style="color: #9b1713">1. Record</h1>
					<p>Record yourself playing a serious match.  Try to get as much of the court in as possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;A smartphone can be used or even an action camera (avoid very wide-angles if possible as they distort the lens making it harder to see distances and movement).&nbsp;&nbsp;Use a court with a glass backwall, if possible.</p>
						<p><strong>Experiment to get the best recording!</strong></p><hr class="grey" >
				 </r-cell>
				 <r-cell span-s=row >
					<h1 style="color: #9b1713">2. Send</h1>
					<p>Either upload it as an unlisted or private YouTube video or host it on a service (like Mega.nz) for me to download.&nbsp;&nbsp;Passsword protect it, if you want to.&nbsp;&nbsp;Send me the link (and password) to squashcoachphillip@gmail.com.  You don't need to edit it.</p>
					<p><strong>Send a link of the recording to me.</strong></p><hr class="grey">
				</r-cell>
				</r-grid>
				<r-grid columns="2">
				<r-cell span-s=row >
					<h1 style="color: #9b1713">3. Wait</h1>
						<p>Expect to hear from me within 24 hours confirming delivery date of full feedback.<br>I usually send the full feedback within a week.&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep training and playing while you wait!</p>
						<p><strong>Now you just have to be a little patient.</strong></p><hr class="grey">
				</r-cell>
				<r-cell span-s=row >
					<h1 style="color: #9b1713">4. Watch/Read</h1>
					<p>I will send you a link to an unlisted YouTube video.&nbsp;&nbsp;Only you have the link.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can share it if you want to.<br>Watch the video, multiple times if needed to make sure you understand what you need to work on.<br>Refer to the PDF feedback sheet if your package includes one.</p>
						<p><strong>Take the time to watch & read carefully.</strong></p><hr class="grey">
				 </r-cell>
				 </r-grid>
				<r-grid columns="2">
				<r-cell span-s=row >
					<h1 style="color: #9b1713">5. Ask</h1>
					<p>If after watching and reading the feedback I have provided you still have questions or doubts, contact me for clarification.&nbsp;&nbsp;I will respond in the most appropriate way, which could include another short video or more likely a text reply to your email.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you chose the FULL package, we can chat on Skype if you want to.</p>
					<p><strong>Please ask, if you have any doubts.</strong></p><hr class="grey">
				</r-cell>		
				<r-cell span-s=row >
					<h1 style="color: #9b1713">6. Implement & Improve!</h1>
						<p>The easy part is over.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, it is time for hard work.<br>My feedback is structured to show you the 3 most important aspects to focus on and HOW to do that.<br>There will also be side-items for you work on if you have the time and motivation.</p>
						<p><strong>It is at this point you pay via PayPal.</strong></p>

					<h2>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h2>
					<p>Here are the most commonly asked questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have others please feel free to contact me and I will do my best to answer them.</p>	
							<ul>
								<li><strong>AFTER USING THIS SERVICE, WILL I BE ABLE TO BEAT MY ARCH-NEMESIS?</strong><br><blockquote><em>ABSOLUTELY! Well, possibly.&nbsp;&nbsp;If your video is of you playing him or her, make sure you tell me that you specifically want to beat this player and I will give you tips to not only improve your game, but also counter your nemesis' strengths and exploit their weaknesses.</em></blockquote></li>
								<li><strong>ENGLISH IS NOT MY FIRST LANGAUGE, WILL I STILL BENEFIT FROM THE SERVICE?</strong><br><blockquote><em>Yes, definitely.&nbsp;&nbsp;If I know English is not your first language, I will speak slower, use clearer words and avoid phrasal verbs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Please let me know when you send your initial email.</em></blockquote></li>
								<li><strong>WHAT HAPPENS IF I DON'T FEEL I RECEIVED GOOD VALUE FOR MONEY?</strong><br><blockquote><em>Notice that you do not pay until AFTER you have received the feedback video.&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask you to pay AFTER because I understand this is a new way to do this.&nbsp;&nbsp;I trust you and I hope you trust me.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you really do not feel that what you got was good value, then you can pay what you think it is worth.</em></blockquote></li>
								<li><strong>WHAT TYPE OF FEEDBACK WILL I RECIEVE?</strong><br><blockquote><em>I focus on two aspects: the tactical and technical.&nbsp;&nbsp;I will highlight tactical mistakes you made, but also highlight the correct shot selection too.&nbsp;&nbsp;I will talk about the technical issues you may have and how that affects your tactical choices.</em></blockquote></li>
								<li><strong>I AM A JUNIOR, CAN I STILL USE THIS SERVICE?</strong><br><blockquote><em>Yes, but I require contact and communication through a parent or guardian.</em></blockquote></li>
								<li><strong>CAN I PAY WITH MY CREDIT CARD?</strong><br><blockquote><em>Yes, but I require all payments to go through PayPal.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can use your credit card to pay via PayPal.</em></blockquote></li>
								<li><strong>WILL YOU OFFER OTHER WAYS TO PAY IN THE FUTURE BESIDES PAYPAL?</strong><br><blockquote><em>Honestly, I do not know.&nbsp;&nbsp;I may consider other payment services if they are easy to work with.</em></blockquote></li>
								<li><strong>I ONLY HAVE A MOBILE PHONE. CAN I USE THAT TO RECORD MY VIDEO?</strong><br><blockquote><em>I have received videos recorded via a mobile phone and it was fine.  of course, it depends on the quality of your phone and where it is positioned.</em></blockquote></li>
								<li><strong>CAN I SEE A SAMPLE FEEDBACK VIDEO?</strong><br><blockquote><em>Yes.  Here is a <a href="https://youtu.be/s9HJn9C8OcQ?t=242">link to my original announcement video which has a short example</a>.</em></blockquote></li>
								<li><strong>I HAVE A QUESTION THAT IS NOT ANSWERED HERE, WHAT SHOULD I DO?</strong><br><blockquote><em>Send me an email and I will do my best to answer your question: <a href="mailto:squashcoachphillip@gmail.com?Subject=RemoteSquashCoach">squashcoachphillip@gmail.com</a>.</em></blockquote></li>

					<h2>TESTIMONIAL</h2>
														<blockquote><p><em>The service provided by Phillip helped me see rapid improvement in my game.<br>He provided very clear analysis of both the things I'm doing well and the things I need to improve.<br>He walked me through a number of drills I can do on my own to target my weaknesses.<br>In the month since I received my coaching video my player rating has steadily risen, and I feel much more confident on court.<br>I'm sure I wouldn't have had this success if I hadn't used his service. I highly recommend Coach Phillip.</em><br><strong>Henry Holderness, March 2020.</strong></p></blockquote>
