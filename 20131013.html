<h2>Time for a new Squash Roadshow?</h2>
<p>Back in the 1990s the <a href="https://www.englandsquash.com/">Squash Rackets Association</a>, in conjunction with <a href="https://dunlopsports.com/">Dunlop</a>, created something called the SRA Dunlop Roadshow.<br><br>It visited two squash clubs/leisure centres in a weekend. It ran from around October to April, although not every weekend had an event.<br><br>It introduced squash to over 15,000 children.<br><br>There were two sessions per day, one in the morning for 5-10 year olds and one in the afternoon for 11 and older. Sometimes we used Mini-Squash in the morning.<br><br>Each session was about 2 hours long and included a video, a fun-based exhibition match, along with a 40/60 minute session on court and then a prize giveaway.<br><br>We used Dunlop contracted coaches as part of their contract. As part of the agreement to host a Roadshow, a club or centre had to organize affordable courses for all the children who wanted to play.<br><br>It was excellent experience for the coaches and even professional players came along to help - It's how I meet <a href="http://www.jonahbarrington.com/">Jonah</a>! I worked on it as one of the coaches for 2 years and then ran it for another 2 and loved every minute of it.<br><br>Since the discussion sparked by Richard Millman's (he was one of the coaches too, if I remember correctly) piece about the state of the game, it seems to me that this concept would be perfect for creating a new generation of players.<br><br>Nothing works better than a national programme, supported by the official association and promoted by a serious squash brand.<br><br>The question is, would it work now?<br><br>I can't believe it wouldn't.<br><br>If anybody is interested in starting the ball rolling, please contact me. I'll help as much as I can - including running the weekends....</p>
